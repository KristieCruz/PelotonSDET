PelotonLoginandShop:
To be run in Eclipse as a Java application with Selenium external JARs added to the Classpath. 

What PelotonLoginandShop is solving:
PelotonLoginandShop is solving the navigation to login and shop on the Peloton site. 

What PelotonLoginandShop is doing:
PelotonLoginandShop is determining whether or not the Sign In options are available for the user. By maximizing the instantiated browser window, it is allowing for a higher possibling of the element 'Sign In' to be found'. Alternatively, if an exception is thrown, the browser is directed to the login page where a list of email and passwords are entered welcoming the user to a more interactive exerience or asking them to try again. PelotonLoginandShop also features a nested for loop to demonstrate login attempts in high volume. 
With more time:
PelotonLoginandShop would have investigated how to automate with respect to a user forgetting their password (which would be suggested after many login failures) and captcha (which occurs when logging in repeatedly).
